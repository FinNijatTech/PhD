# PhD

This PhD research aims to develop a novel index powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess the stability of banks by analyzing social media posts, news articles, and other textual data. The motivation behind this research stems from the limitations of traditional financial assessment tools, which often fail to predict bank instability, as seen in cases like the 2008 financial crisis, Silicon Valley Bank, and Credit Suisse failures.

The proposed index will incorporate sentiment analysis and topic modeling to provide real-time, nuanced insights into bank stability. This will allow for more frequent and responsive financial predictions compared to traditional credit rating systems that are updated quarterly. The research methodology involves collecting textual data from various sources, including social media and financial news, followed by data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, feature extraction, and the use of machine learning models to predict bank stability.

The work will span four years, with the initial focus on gathering data and developing NLP models, followed by index development, validation, and real-world testing. The final output will be a comprehensive NLP-based index that can enhance decision-making in financial risk management.
