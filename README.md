# PhD

This PhD research aims to develop an innovative index combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with traditional financial and macroeconomic data to assess bank stability. The index will analyze sentiment from social media posts, news articles, and financial reports, integrating this real-time data with conventional economic indicators, such as stock prices, financial statements, and market trends.

Motivated by the limitations of traditional credit rating systems—which often fail to provide timely warnings of bank instability—the research proposes a more dynamic approach. Historical examples, like the 2008 financial crisis and the recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, demonstrate the inadequacies of conventional models. The proposed NLP-driven index, enhanced by financial and macroeconomic data, aims to deliver more accurate, timely predictions.

The methodology involves collecting textual data (social media, news) alongside financial data (e.g., stock market trends, macroeconomic indicators). Using machine learning models, the research will develop an index that scores banks' stability, providing early warnings of potential failures. The project will backtest and validate the index against historical financial data to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.

This four-year project will culminate in a refined, real-time tool that benefits researchers, financial institutions, and regulators by offering better risk assessment and decision-making support.
